    今天在公司看了一天书, 当然还做了一点测试工作.
    下午和在学校的老同学聊了会天, 感觉非常好, 各种漫无边际的段子. 不过还是比较佩服那个同学(HZAU11级信息系的).
他非常喜欢数学, 但是对于编程好像不怎么感兴趣(matlab除外), 他数学应该非常好, 至于好到什么程度我不知道, 我比较
欣赏他并不是他成绩好而是他能坚持, 我每次去图书馆总能在特定的位置看到他, 总是很认真的在看书, 偶尔在食堂遇到会
交流一会, 虽然平时并没太多交集但是总能聊上好一会. 他好像也比较乐意和我聊, 每次总以大神称呼我, 表示不配, 但已
习惯. 不过今天和他聊天的内容有点不上路子, 我调侃他光棍, 他老拿我EX说事, 反正笑死了.
    今天在quora上提了第一个问题 "I'm a computer science student in China, how i can learn English well", 
一个名 Isla Harlow 的给了好多建议, 世界上还是好人多. 我在想是不是要在什么时候开始写英语日记了, 虽然会非常非常
的烂. But learn more use more, if you really want do something, don't histate, just do it now.

    Here is text written by Isla Harlow

    The same way anyone learns English. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. I find a balance of these four skills to be the most beneficial, but it can vary from person to person, I suppose.

    For reading you can use Quora or just books / articles / etc.. The important thing is to read things that interest you. That way you can remain motivated. Challenge yourself, but don't make your material so difficult that you become overly frustrated.

    You can write on Quora too. Don't be shy. For this it is important that you include a note at the bottom of your answers / blog posts / etc. asking for edits. If someone suggests an edit you don't understand, ask them about it via Quora's message feature.

    For listening, English movies are usually a good bet.

    Speaking is the hardest part, both for practicality and for the fear that arises quite naturally from attempting to communicate more-or-less spontaneously with someone in a language you are not totally comfortable with. Regardless, note that most people are willing to help you. To find people with whom to communicate, I suggest either face-to-face contact or finding someone on Quora who is willing to Skype with you.

    If you have a specific question, feel free to message me.

    (By the way, I suppose I wrote this answer with the assumption that you have basic English skills and merely would like to practice andexpand upon these skills. If this is not your situation, I'm not sure if I have any advice.)

    Best of luck.
